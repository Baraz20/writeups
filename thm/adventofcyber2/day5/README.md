For me the ip for the machine was:`10.10.3.234` it probably be diffrent for you.

## Question 1
*Without using directory brute forcing, what's Santa's secret login panel?*

after hading to `http://10.10.3.234:8000/` (like the text about suggested) and not seeing anything potentially vulnerable
and after looking at the hint: *The name is derived out of 2 words from this question.*

So I tried:
- /secretpanel
- /secretlogin
- /loginpanel
- /santalogin
- /santasecret

and finally got it right on
- /santapanel
I've probably could have guest that the first time by just looking at the length of the answer.

## Question 2

## Question 3

## Question 4

## Question 5
